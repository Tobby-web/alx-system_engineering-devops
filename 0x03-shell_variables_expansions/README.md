Here the third project on shell from alx. Later on I'll update this read me to provide a proper description of the files present. Forgive me for now because I've not done that.
I used that alias stuff we were taught to automate my git add -A, git commit -m "done", and git push. It helped a lot to do the boring stuff. Don't mind the done you keep seeing repeatedly in the commit.
I'll have to upgrade so that I can vary the commit.
